#ðŸ“Š Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains my work from the Data Analysis with Python course. The project demonstrates how to explore, analyze, and visualize data using Python and popular libraries.

##ðŸ”¹ Key Topics Covered

Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy

Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical features

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Statistical analysis and correlation studies

Building and evaluating regression models with Scikit-Learn

Cross-validation, polynomial regression, and model performance metrics (RÂ², MSE)

##ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

Python (3.x)

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-Learn

##ðŸ”¹ Outcomes

Through this project, I:

Gained hands-on experience in extracting insights from real-world datasets

Understood how to select, preprocess, and transform data for analysis

Learned to apply regression techniques and evaluate models effectively

Developed confidence in using Python for data-driven decision making
